<p>
    Pigeon is an <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a> framework for rapid prototyping and building
    smart, scalable websites. Pigeon is easy to use and
    <a href="/docs/config/">highly configurable</a>, you can use it with either plain CSS or Sass.

    <h2>Why Pigeon?</h2>

    <p>
        Pigeon was originally thought up as a simple way for me to manage my own set of common OOCSS
        classes. It soon became apparent that it was difficult to use these classes in isolation
        without any kind of base typography for the page. I also found that I was hacking around the
        code in each separate project to tweak spacings of elements, I wanted this to be more
        configurable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pigeon aims to tackle my original problem by providing a simple set of CSS objects for
        laying out typography and simple components. It accepts
        <a href="/docs/config">configurations through Sass variables</a> which means it can be
        included in a project and updated freely without touching your site's code.

    <h2>What Pigeon Isn't</h2>

    <p>
        Pigeon doesn't dictate design for you, or provide stylistic classes. That's your job.
        If you're looking for a more full design/CSS framework, I recommend looking into
        <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> or
        <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pigeon doesn't provide a grid system. If you're looking for one with a similar style,
        I recommend <a href="http://frag.rowanmanning.com/">Frag â€“ a fluid, responsive grid system for CSS</a>.
