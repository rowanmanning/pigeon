How To Contribute
=================

Pigeon accepts contributions from anyone, as long as you follow the guidelines below.


Features
--------

We won't accept features which radically deviate from the key goals of Pigeon – a simple, light-weight OOCSS framework.

For example, don't try to get a grid system or hyper-specific styles merged in :)


Refactoring
-----------

We will accept refactors where it makes an improvement to the maintainability of the code-base or makes code more readable/understandable. If there needs to be a discussion over what's readable or not, chat about it in a pull-request.


Coding Guidelines
-----------------

* No trailing whitespace please (except in Markdown)
* Generally follow the style that is currently present in the code – consistency is important
* Test changes in all supported browsers (see readme)
* Keep indentation consistent (four spaces)
