<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
    You can use Pigeon in a couple of different ways, depending on the way your
    site is being developed.
</p>


<h2 class="space-above-2">Plain CSS</h2>

<p>
    If you're just writing vanilla CSS, then you can simply include
    <a href="https://raw.github.com/rowanmanning/pigeon/master/build/pigeon.css">pigeon.css</a>
    or <a href="https://raw.github.com/rowanmanning/pigeon/master/build/pigeon.min.css">pigeon.min.css</a>
    in your page above your own styles.
</p>

<p>
    If you need to customise pigeon, you can do so by tweaking
    <a href="https://github.com/rowanmanning/pigeon/blob/master/lib/defaults.scss">the default variables</a>
    and rebuilding the CSS.
</p>


<h2 class="space-above-2">Sass</h2>

<p>
    If you're already using Sass with your project, then you can include Pigeon
    directly. This is simple; assuming you have the Pigeon source code in
    the <code>vendor/pigeon</code> folder:
</p>

{% highlight scss %}
@import "vendor/pigeon/lib/pigeon";
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    If you wish to customise Pigeon, you can do so using Sass variables. You can
    find <a href="/docs/config/">documentation for customising Pigeon here</a>.
</p>


<h2 class="space-above-2">Usage</h2>

<p>
    Once you're set up, you can start using the wealth of CSS objects provided
    by Pigeon. <a href="/docs/objects/">Read about CSS objects here</a>.
